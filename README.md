# Avanza-brokerage
Python app for calculating avanza brokerage-fees and more

![image](https://github.com/antonschulz/Avanza-brokerage/blob/master/app.png)

Uses the excel-sheet that can be downloaded from Avanza and calculates fees over the provided time-period as well as total saving and more. 
The calculations are done mainly using the pandas library in python (seen in the AvanzaClass.py file). The GUI is created in Tkinter.

(NOTE: This code is an old project that was recently re-commited to github. The code could probably be way cleaner if rewritten today)
